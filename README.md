# Basic GPIO with Python on Resin
This is a basic example of GPIO control on the Rasperry Pi using Python

We use the GPIO board pin mapping and we also need few LEDs on two sets of GPIO pin:

Set A: 3,5,7,8,10,11,12,13,15 (pin number)
Set B: 16.18,19,21,22,23,24,26 (pin number)

Using this led will be only in on state continuously.

* enjoy the all the LED goodness...
